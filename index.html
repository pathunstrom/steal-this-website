<h1>Steal This Website</h1>
<p>
  This website is a series of examples of web technologies all done as a single
  page with detailed comments, so you can <strong>Steal This Website</strong>.
</p>
<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>
  Due to the stripped down nature of this website, it is not intended for complete beginners.
  If you want a gentle introduction to HTML (and thus the skill set you need to effectively <strong>Steal This Website</strong>),
  check out <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com/">HTML for People</a>.
</p>
<p>
  To use, open the dev tools in your browser
  (<a href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/">Firefox instructions</a>)
  and examine the source files.
  Each feature will be well detailed with html comments.
</p>
<p>
  You can usually view the source of a page by using the context menu
  (the menu that pops up when you right-click with a mouse)
  and using the "View source" option or similar.
</p>
<p>They look like this:</p>
<blockquote>&lt;!-- This is a comment --&gt;</blockquote>
<!-- This is what a comment looks like in the source. -->
